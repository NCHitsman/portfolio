                    I was led to Software Engineering by a desire to be
                    challenged and find solutions to complex problems. I always
                    strive to make my solutions scalable, efficient, and
                    progressive. I always try to include the most advanced, and
                    breaking-edge technology in my projects, and I am proud to
                    know that I bring interesting ideas with efficient standards
                    to any team I join.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>I decided to further my education by attending App
                    Academyâ€™s 24-week, 1000+ hour Software Engineering program
                    where I honed my expertise in Typescript, React, Redux, CSS,
                    Python, Flask, along with many other
                    technologies. Given my strong technical experience, I am
                    confident in my ability to contribute from day one as a
                    Full-Stack Developer on any Project.
